# FFVIII_LAUNCHER-Alternative
This is a drop in replacement to the FFVIII remaster launcher. It just starts the game and exits. 


This is very simple you just put this in place of your FFVIII_LAUNCHER.exe and when you run this or FFVIII the game pretty much just starts. You may see a console box. That is just this running. It exits soon as the game is launched. I had issue with a mod I was trying to run that was interfering with the normal FFVIII_LAUNCHER.exe. So I looked at what the real launcher does to run the game and made this.
